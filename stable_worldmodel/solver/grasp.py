"""GRASP: Gradient RelAxed Stochastic Planner for model-based planning.

Reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00475

This solver jointly optimises virtual intermediate latent states and actions
via stop-gradient dynamics, goal shaping, Langevin-style state noise, and a
periodic full-rollout sync that calls ``model.get_cost``.

Unlike the reference implementations, this version does **not** hard-code an
MSE loss in sync phases; it delegates cost computation entirely to
``model.get_cost`` from the stable-worldmodel :class:`.Costable` interface.

The model passed to :class:`GRASPSolver` must expose:

* **get_cost** (the :class:`.Costable` protocol) — used during periodic
  sync steps to ground the terminal state to the goal.
* **rollout** (the :class:`.Rollable` protocol) — used for single-step
  differentiable latent predictions in the main GRASP optimisation loop.

``info_dict`` passed to :meth:`GRASPSolver.solve` must contain:

* ``emb_key`` (default ``'emb'``): ``(B, D)`` initial latent embedding.
* ``goal_emb_key`` (default ``'goal_emb'``): ``(B, D)`` goal latent embedding.
* Any additional keys required by ``model.get_cost`` (e.g. pixel observations
  for the sync pass).

class GRASPSolver:
    """GRASP: Gradient RelAxed Stochastic Planner.

    Reference: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00475

    Jointly optimises virtual intermediate latent states ``s_1 .. s_{T-1}``
    and actions ``a_0 .. a_{T-1}`` by minimising:

    .. math::

        \\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}
            \\|F(\\bar{s}_t,\\, a_t) - s_{t+1}\\|^2
            + \\lambda_{\\text{goal}}
            \\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \\|F(\\bar{s}_t,\\, a_t) - g\\|^2

    where :math:`\\bar{s}_t` denotes the stop-gradient of the virtual state at
    step *t*, ``s_0`` is the encoded initial observation (fixed), and
    ``s_T = g`` (the goal embedding, also fixed).

    Every ``gd_interval`` gradient steps a full-rollout sync pass is
    triggered.  Two sync strategies are available via ``sync_mode``:

    * ``'gd'`` — short Adam optimisation on a cloned copy of the actions using
      ``model.get_cost`` (differentiable, uniform treatment across timesteps).
    * ``'cem'`` — gradient-free Cross Entropy Method using ``model.get_cost``
      (more robust in non-smooth cost landscapes; uses per-timestep adaptive
      variance derived from virtual-state drift relative to the linear
      interpolation baseline).

    Between gradient steps Langevin-style Gaussian noise is injected into the
    virtual states to escape local minima.  With ``schedule_decay=True``, both
    the noise scale and the goal weight anneal linearly from their initial
    values to their minimum values within each sync phase (or over all
    ``n_steps`` when ``gd_interval=0``), trading exploration for exploitation
    as optimisation proceeds.

    When ``n_envs`` is large and the full batch does not fit in GPU memory,
    set ``batch_size`` to chunk environments into sub-batches.  Each sub-batch
    runs the full ``n_steps`` optimisation independently.

    Args:
        model: World model implementing :class:`.Costable` (``get_cost``)
            and :class:`.Rollable` (``rollout``).
        n_steps: Total number of optimisation iterations per environment
            batch.
        batch_size: Number of environments to process in a single pass.
            ``None`` processes all environments together.
        lr_s: Learning rate for virtual-state optimisation.
        lr_a: Learning rate for action optimisation.
        goal_weight: Fixed weighting coefficient :math:`\\lambda_{\\text{goal}}`
            for the per-step goal loss (used when ``schedule_decay=False``).
        state_noise_scale: Fixed standard deviation of Langevin-style noise
            added to the virtual states (used when ``schedule_decay=False``).
        gd_interval: Run the sync step every this many iterations.
            ``0`` disables the sync entirely.
        gd_opt_steps: Number of optimisation steps inside each sync pass
            (gradient steps for ``sync_mode='gd'``; CEM iterations for
            ``sync_mode='cem'``).
        gd_lr: Learning rate for the GD sync-pass Adam optimiser (only used
            when ``sync_mode='gd'``).
        sync_mode: Sync strategy — ``'gd'`` (gradient descent, default) or
            ``'cem'`` (Cross Entropy Method).
        cem_sync_samples: Number of candidate action sequences sampled per CEM
            iteration (only used when ``sync_mode='cem'``).
        cem_sync_topk: Number of elite samples kept for the CEM update (only
            used when ``sync_mode='cem'``).
        cem_sync_var_scale: Scaling factor applied to the per-timestep adaptive
            variance in CEM sync (only used when ``sync_mode='cem'``).
        cem_sync_var_min: Minimum variance floor for CEM sync to prevent
            premature distribution collapse (only used when
            ``sync_mode='cem'``).
        schedule_decay: When ``True``, both the state noise scale and the goal
            loss weight decay linearly from their initial to minimum values
            within each sync phase (or over all ``n_steps`` when
            ``gd_interval=0``).
        init_noise_scale: Initial Langevin noise scale at the start of each
            phase (only used when ``schedule_decay=True``).
        min_noise_scale: Final Langevin noise scale at the end of each phase
            (only used when ``schedule_decay=True``).
        init_goal_weight: Initial goal loss weight at the start of each phase
            (only used when ``schedule_decay=True``).
        min_goal_weight: Final goal loss weight at the end of each phase
            (only used when ``schedule_decay=True``).
        emb_key: Key in ``info_dict`` for the initial latent embedding.
        goal_emb_key: Key in ``info_dict`` for the goal latent embedding.
        device: Device for tensor computations.
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility.
